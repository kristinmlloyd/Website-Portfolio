<section id="goals" class="level1">
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this phase was to gather comprehensive data on wrongful convictions and death penalty cases in the United States. By collecting and organizing this data, the aim was to enable in-depth analysis and storytelling that highlights systemic factors influencing convictions and sentencing disparities. The datasets obtained serve as a foundation for identifying patterns, biases, and inequities within the justice system.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/scale.jpg" class="img-fluid" data-align="left" width="200"></p>
</section>
<section id="motivation" class="level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scraping data from death penalty petitions offers a unique perspective on public advocacy efforts and societal attitudes toward capital punishment. These petitions reflect collective arguments and emotional appeals, often aiming to mobilize public support or sway decision-makers. Performing emotional analysis on petition descriptions allows for an assessment of whether these documents effectively convey emotions such as urgency, empathy, or outrage—critical factors in driving public engagement and influencing policy change.</li>
<li>Data on individuals who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated is crucial for understanding the underlying causes of judicial errors. By examining systemic issues such as racial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, and flaws in forensic science, the data provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of the justice system. This analysis helps uncover patterns that contribute to wrongful convictions, highlighting areas for reform.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../assets/light.jpg" class="img-fluid" data-align="left" width="200"></p>
</section>
<section id="objectives" class="level1">
<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>Collect data on exonerees from the Innocence Project website, including details such as name, state, charge, conviction, sentence, and exoneration.</li>
<li>Extract petition information related to the death penalty from the Action Network platform.</li>
<li>Leverage the Wikipedia API to retrieve and analyze key terms and concepts associated with capital punishment, enhancing the context for the collected data.</li>
</ul>
<section id="webscraping-from-the-innocence-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webscraping-from-the-innocence-project">Webscraping from The Innocence Project</h2>
<p>This phase involved designing and implementing a Python-based web scraping workflow to extract case details from the Innocence Project website. The following steps outline the process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Tools and Frameworks</strong>: The scraping process utilized Selenium, a powerful browser automation tool, to navigate the dynamic content on the website.</li>
<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Information about exonerees, including their name, state, charge, conviction, sentence, and additional case details, was systematically extracted. Two specific datasets were targeted:
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive table listing all exonerees.</li>
<li>A focused table detailing exonerees who faced death penalty convictions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>XPath Selectors</strong>: Pre-defined XPath selectors were used to locate and extract specific elements from the webpage. This ensured accurate and efficient data extraction.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: The script was designed to loop through a list of case pages, automatically processing each one and saving the extracted data into structured CSV files.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>: The data was stored in two separate CSV files for ease of analysis:
<ul>
<li>One containing all exonerees.</li>
<li>One specifically focused on exonerees who were sentenced to death.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This approach streamlined the data collection process and ensured the accuracy and completeness of the datasets.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-an-api-to-collect-data-from-wikipidia">Using an API to collect data from Wikipidia</h2>
<p>Before starting my project, I used the Wikipedia API to extract text from the “Death Penalty in the United States” page. After cleaning the extracted data to remove stop words and irrelevant characters, I generated a word cloud. This visualization highlighted key terms such as “African American,” , “black”, “black people”, “unconstitutional,” and “justice,” providing a quick and effective overview of the central themes surrounding the death penalty. The process of creating the word cloud offered a preliminary understanding of the context, helping to guide the direction of my project and framing the broader narrative for analysis.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In collecting data for this project, I combined information from different sources to create a detailed dataset on the death penalty. Along with analyzing text from Wikipedia to understand public sentiment and history, I added raw CSV files that include key details like which states have the death penalty, the race of exonerees and victims, county-level data, and sentence lengths. This comprehensive dataset gives a clear picture of the factors and patterns surrounding the death penalty in the U.S.</p>
<section id="challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exoneree details were not present on the main listing page and required navigating to individual pages by clicking on the exoneree’s name. I identified the pattern in the URL structure and looped through a pre-defined list of names to directly access individual pages.</li>
<li>As a beginner in web scraping, understanding the technical concepts of HTML structure, XPath, and CSS selectors was initially overwhelming. I leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn the foundational concepts of web scraping.</li>

<p>The dataset represents a comprehensive collection of capital punishment information in the United States, integrating multiple key sources. The core data includes case details through sentences.csv and nationwide outcome statistics, providing baseline metrics for analysis. A significant portion focuses on wrongful convictions and exonerations through two detailed Innocence Project datasets, capturing both death penalty-specific cases and their broader case database. The execution data is particularly extensive, containing historical records through executions_database.csv, documented cases of botched executions, and a complete execution record. The dataset also maintains forward-looking data with scheduled executions planned through 2027. Geographic and demographic analysis is enabled through county-level data (counties.csv) and state policy information (has_death_penalty.csv). The inclusion of GSS2002 survey data provides valuable public opinion context, while the petitions_descriptions.csv offers insights into advocacy and public discourse surrounding capital punishment.</p>
