# Making Data Matter {.impact-title}
I am driven by the power of data to to examine systematic inequities, uncover patterns of injustice, and advocate for meaningful change. Through my work, I transform complex datasets into clear narratives that expose systemic inequities and patterns of injustice. My research portfolio reflects my commitment to tackling pressing societal challenges - from maternal health disparities to criminal justice reform. I believe in letting data tell its own story, maintaining objectivity while uncovering insights that can drive meaningful policy and social impact. Beyond my focus on social justice, I apply these same analytical skills to help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.
