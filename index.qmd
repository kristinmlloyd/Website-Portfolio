Hi, I’m Kristin Lloyd! I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University, where I’m building expertise in areas like statistical computing, climate change data science, and advanced analytics. Before that, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Business Analytics from Towson University, graduating with honors and multiple awards.
