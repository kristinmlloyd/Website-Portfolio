        <h2>The "Original" Crisis in New York City</h2>
        <p>This visualization tells the story of the HIV epidemic in New York, showing how the lack of timely action contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. The following is a <b> data-driven </b> visualization, where each red ribbon represents approximately 2,400 people in New York (150,000 in total).</p>
        <p>As you scroll through the years, the red ribbons – the international symbol of HIV/AIDS awareness – will fade away, representing lives lost. Let’s follow the story of how HIV/AIDS was covered in New York and abroad from the early discovery to now. You’ll learn about the AIDS crisis and the total accumulated reported cases and deaths within New York at the time.</p>

It was brought to reduce the stigma associated with the disease. However, criminalization laws emerged during the early aughts, ones that punish people living with HIV for having sex, even when undetectable (or unable to be transmitted through sexual contact). In New York specifically, young black gay men see infection rates higher than any other group, but are labeled by health organizations as “hard to reach” instead of “worth reaching”.</p>

        <h2>Remembering those who Fought</h2>
        <p class="context">This highlights the importance of historical education, particularly when it comes to how current perceptions of HIV/AIDS impact marginalized communities. The 1980s and lack of support paved the way for cases to exponentially rise over the next couple of decades, caused by the classification of this disease as a “gay disease”. This stigma still instantiates itself in structures around us, like with blood donations. Although modern medicine has continuously attempted to combat this, it’s become politically-charged and will only continue to be addressed when bureaucratic structures are in favor of action. Furthermore, this disease disproportionately affects certain populations, as you’ll learn in the rest of this report, but that doesn’t mean cases aren’t arising in all populations. </p>

        <p class="context">Lastly, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to analyze and study the still at-large impacts of HIV/AIDS, as current data is being purged on many sites like the CDC, preventing holistic analysis from taking place. It’s important to not only acknowledge its current impact, but its historical precedence in the predisposition of the queer people of color communities that it impacted the most. New York was crucial to early developments of research, stigma, and overall origination of HIV/AIDS coverage across the globe.
