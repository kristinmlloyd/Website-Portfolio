However, the clustering analysis reveals that the distribution of these sentences across jurisdictions is uneven.\nOnly 175 jurisdictions show a pattern of predominantly sentencing Black individuals compared to 408 sub-jurisdictions that predominantly sentence White individuals. Yet, the total number of sentences between races was similar\nThis suggests that the sub-jurisdictions in Cluster 1, while fewer in number, must be issuing death sentences at a higher rate or volume to achieve similar total numbers.

Some of the largest bubbles (indicating highest number of cases) appear in Cluster 1, where there are higher proportions of black death sentences. This means that while there are fewer sub-jurisdictions predominantly sentencing Black individuals, these sub-jurisdictions tend to handle a larger volume of cases. This explains how the total number of Black death sentences can be similar to White death sentences despite fewer sub-jurisdictions. On the other hand, there are many sub-jurisdictions with high white proportions but generally smaller bubbles (lower case volumes)."

    "text": "We believe that the adoption of LLM tools is inevitable and will be an important skill for success in your future career. Therefore, appropriate and acceptable use of LLM tools is encouraged for this project. Use them to accelerate your workflow and learning, but not as a replacement for critical thinking and understanding. Carefully review and process their output, use them judiciously, and avoid bloating your text with LLM-generated content. Overusing these tools often degrades the quality of your work rather than enhancing it.\nRemember the following guidelines:\n\nUse common sense: If you feel like you’re doing something questionable, you probably are. A good test is to ask yourself, “Would I openly tell the professor or classmates what I’m doing right now?” If the answer is no, you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.\nCite your LLM use cases: Always cite when and how you’ve used LLM tools. This is a requirement for the project.\nIs your use helping you grow professionally?: If your use of LLM tools is making you a more competent, efficient, and knowledgeable professional, you’re probably using them in an appropriate manner. If you’re using them as a shortcut to avoid work and gain free time, you’re using them incorrectly.\n\n\n\nALWAY CITE CONTENT OR IDEAS TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES: e.g. websites, llm tools, papers\nALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT WHEN YOU ARE USING LLM TOOLS:\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\nGeneral Tasks: Create and regularly update a dedicated LLM Transparency page to document how you are using LLM tools.\n\nThis page can serve as a “catch-all” for use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.\n\nContent Creation: If non-original content (code or text) is generated by an LLM, you must also cite it on specific pages, just like any external source.\n\nFor non-original content, always provide a citation.\nCite the LLM tool after each chunk of text or code it generates, using a BibTeX.

    "text": "Remember, slow and steady wins the race\nMaking steady, incremental progress on a large project generally makes it more manageable. Rushing to throw something together under a tight deadline often turns the process into a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable.\n\n\n\n“Data science” is essentially a collection of useful computational and mathematical skills (statistics, cloud computing, machine learning, coding, etc). However, to maximize your effectiveness, these skills should be applied to a domain of interest (e.g., materials science, finance, healthcare, etc). Focusing and learning about a particular domain will help you specialize and make you more marketable.\nThat beind said, don’t worry about choosing the “perfect” domain—it’s always possible to pivot later, as many of the skills learned, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-education, are transferable across all fields.\n\n\n\nImpact in science refers to the significance and influence of research, often measured by metrics like citations, impact factor of journals, and indices like h-index. These metrics reflect how widely recognized and valuable the work is within the scientific community. Such quanities are used to compare researchers and journals, and are used to determine grant funding and career opportunities.\n\nImpact Factor (IF):\n\nA measure of a journal’s influence, calculated by averaging the number of citations to articles published in the journal over the past two years.\nHigher impact factors indicate a more influential journal.\n\nNumber of Citations:\n\nThe total count of how often a researcher’s work is cited by others, reflecting its influence within the scientific community.\nMore citations generally signal broader recognition or relevance of the research.\n\nh-index:\n\nA metric that measures both productivity and citation impact. An h-index of 10 means a researcher has 10 papers each cited at least 10 times.\nHigher h-index indicates more influential and widely recognized work.\n\ni10-index:\n\nCounts the number of a researcher’s publications with at least 10 citations.\nA straightforward measure of citation impact, commonly used by Google Scholar.\n\nImportance of Citations:\n\nCitations indicate that other researchers find the work valuable for their own research, increasing its perceived credibility and impact in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional academic or industrial research is all about discovery, improvement, and novelty. You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important.\n\n\n\n80-20 Rule: This rule of thumb suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small number of key factors drive the majority of outcomes. This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop. Strive to take this project as far as possible, but remember to stop and “call it done” at some point.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations are a critical component of your portfolio. Use them strategically to support your narrative. The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade. Ensure that all graphics follow best practices:\n\nChoose the right chart type: Match the chart to the data (e.g., bar for categories, line for trends).\nMaintain simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the essential message.\nUse appropriate scales: Ensure axes have correct and intuitive scaling to avoid misinterpretation.\nLabel axes clearly: Include meaningful axis labels with units (e.g., “Temperature (°C)” or “Revenue (USD)”).\nInclude descriptive titles: Provide a concise, informative title that explains the visualization’s main takeaway.\nEnsure consistency: Use uniform color schemes, fonts, and styles across all charts in a presentation.\nHighlight key data: Use contrasting colors or annotations to draw attention to important points or trends.\nKeep proportions accurate: Maintain correct data-to-visual size relationships to avoid distortion.\nConsider the audience: Tailor the level of detail and style to the audience’s technical proficiency.\nTest readability: Ensure fonts, colors, and elements are clear and legible in various formats and sizes.\nUse interactivity carefully: Interactive features should add clarity, not complexity, to the visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not required, practice is highly beneficial. It’s also a good habit to write your code from scratch, as this will build your problem-solving skills. You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project .\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember the following Debugging Steps:\n\nStep A: Copy the error message and search it online (Google or similar).\nStep B: Look through forums or documentation to find a solution.\nStep C: Implement the solution.\nStep D: If you’re still stuck, ask for help from classmates, TAs, or professors.\nStep E: Move on to the next issue and repeat the process.\n\n\n(Note: You can also use ChatGPT for debugging, but be cautious as the solutions may sometimes be inaccurate or incomplete.)"

    "text": "This is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop.

You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\n\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

The analysis contrasts two main arguments: the “mass market” claim, which suggests Black offenders are disproportionately sentenced to death, and the “specialist” argument, which highlights the undervaluation of Black victims in murder cases.\n\nKey Findings\n\n\nVictim Race Matters\n\nOffenders who kill White victims are far more likely to receive the death penalty than those who kill Black victims.\nThis trend persists even when controlling for factors like the severity of the crime and aggravating circumstances.\n\n\n\nOffender Race Shows Limited Impact\n\nStudies show little evidence of racial bias against Black offenders in sentencing, once other factors are controlled.\nIn some cases, Black offenders are treated more leniently, particularly in non-capital cases.\n\n\n\nDisparities Across Cases\n\nMost murders are intraracial, with Black-on-Black and White-on-White homicides being the majority.\nBlack-on-White murders are punished more harshly than White-on-White murders, but White-on-Black murders receive harsher treatment than Black-on-Black cases, possibly due to societal or jury biases.\n\n\n\nImplications\n\nThe greatest disparity is in the treatment of Black victims, whose lives are undervalued in the justice system.\nAbolishing the death penalty may remove racial inequities in executions but would not address the broader systemic biases in how crimes are prosecuted and punished."

Technical stakeholders may require detailed explanations of methodologies, while non-technical audiences need clear, simplified insights and data-driven conclusions. Tailoring your message ensures your analysis is both understandable and impactful, driving informed decision-making.\n\nExamples of technical audiences include data scientists, software engineers, and IT professionals. These individuals expect detailed explanations of models, algorithms, methodologies, or system architectures, and they’re comfortable with technical jargon, such as discussing hyperparameters, programming frameworks, or machine learning techniques.\nNon-technical audiences include executives, marketing teams, and clients. They prioritize high-level insights, actionable results, and visualizations that convey the impact of data without requiring an understanding of complex methods. For instance, a CEO may want to know how a model affects business strategy or revenue, without diving into the underlying technical details.\n\nIn this project you will cater to both audiences. This is done by having regions of your website for both audiences (see website struture)"

    "text": "Graduate level work\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

    "text": "What makes a good research project?\nProfessional academic or industrial research is all about discovery, improvement, and novelty. You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable. The key is knowing when to “call it done.” This might happen at 95% or 99% completion, but eventually, we all have to stop.

You can use the code provided by professors as a reference, but always strive to write your own. Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\nPrototype and develop on a small data set\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

    "text": "This project analyzes different factors associated with the use of the death penalty in the United States. The death penalty has always been controversial, and 23 states have already chosen to abolish it (11 of those just in the last 16 years). It is important to study data associated with controversial subjects such as this because sometimes emotion can override facts. There is not only the victim of the crime to consider but use of the death penalty results in the loss of yet another life, impacting families for generations. Studying death penalty cases and patterns may shed light on whether it’s applied fairly, without introducing opinion or bias.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the project is to collect multiple datasets related to the death penalty, clean them, and perform exploratory data analysis to decide which datasets are important to telling the overall story. Once the key datasets have been determined, the objective is to perform different unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods and report on the findings. The focus of the research will be on studying geographical and racial disparities.\n\n\n\nTo begin exploratory data analysis, I looked at how the death penalty has been instituted and abolished over time. In the early years of the United States, most states did permit its use but as we moved towards and into the 20th century, attitudes were changing. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Maine were the first states to abolish it in the mid to late 1800s. Minnesota followed in 1911 and then not much happened until the late 1950s and 1960s when 6 more states abolished it all relatively close to each other. Two more states followed in the 1980s and then there was a steady stream of 11 states from 2007 to 2023, almost a state a year. This leaves 27 states that still permit its use, but the trend could lead us to believe that as time goes by, more and more states will abolish the death penalty.\nEven so, there are still currently over 2,000 inmates on death row and about 30 executions scheduled. Looking at those upcoming executions, we can see that the number from 2024 to 2027 increases almost linearly. When looking more closely, you can see that Ohio significantly exceeds all other states and is the only state with scheduled executions past 2025. This reinforces that while a lot of states have abolished the death penalty, there are still many that are more than comfortable with keeping it implemented.\nIn considering death row outcomes, it is noted that there have been close to 1,600 executions since the 1970s, while during the same period there have been around 250 exonerations. This indicates that around 10% of cases involve an inmate that was falsely accused, which brings into question the accuracy of the judicial system in the United States. The Innocence Project, founded in 1992, has brought attention to this issue and has been instrumental in freeing over 20 death row inmates, each having served jail time ranging from 5 to 22.5 years.\nSentencing data was then analyzed. Figure 1 shows the geographical differences in where death penalty sentences occur. We can conclude from this analysis that one’s likelihood of receiving a death sentence is not only associated with the state they live in but also seems to be heavily influenced by the boundaries of the over 3,000 counties in the United States, raising the question yet again about the fairness in applying the death penalty.\n\n\nFigure 1: Geographic distribution of death penalty cases across counties in the United States\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, when zooming in from state to county level, a relationship is observed where the counts start very high, decrease rapidly, and then taper off, which is a characteristic of exponential decay. This reveals that a small number of counties dominate the count of death penalty sentences.\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of death penalty sentences across counties\n\nTo analyze this further, the cumulative percentage of death penalty cases by county was plotted in Figure 3. Out of the 937 counties that sentenced someone to death, 57 of those counties accounted for 50% of all death penalty sentences. 235 counties accounted for 80% of all cases, which is 25% of all counties.\n\n\nFigure 3: Cumulative percentage of death penalty cases by county, illustrating that a small fraction of counties accounts for the majority of cases, with thresholds at 50% and 80% marked for reference\n\nFrom the same dataset, the race of people sentenced to death was studied. It was concluded that White people make up 47.9% of all death penalty sentences, whereas Black people make up 41%, and Latino/a people make up nearly 9%. Other races account for an insignificant number of sentences and were not considered further. Noting that understanding the overall racial demographics within the counties themselves would be important to understand where there are actually disparities, the analysis that follows also considers census information from those same counties. Therefore, since the census population data being used for this project only spans from 2009-2022, Figure 4 shows the proportions of sentencing during that same timeframe.\n\n\nFigure 4: Racial distribution of death penalty cases by county (2009-2022), with green representing White, blue representing Black, and red representing Latino/a individuals\n\nAs you can see, it is apparent that some counties do sentence a disproportionate amount of each race. Many counties, including Dallas, Duval, Hamilton, Montgomery, Philadelphia, Shelby, Jefferson, and Oklahoma were found to disproportionally sentence Black people to death. Comparing these percentages to the population data, we would expect to see the Black-to-White population ratio above 1 in each of these counties, but what we actually see is that Philadelphia and Shelby are the only counties with a ratio barely exceeding 1. These findings show that despite there being as many or more White than Black people in a given county, Black people were sentenced to death more often. This could be due to the fact that Black people commit more violent crimes than White people, or it could be racial discrimination. Another finding was that a single county accounted for 11.2% of all Latino/a deaths nationwide, whereas Black and White sentences are much more evenly distributed across counties.\nDigging deeper into the data, we determined how many counties actually disproportionally executed Black people. As can be seen in Figure 5, there are three clusters labeled cluster 0, cluster 1, and cluster 2.\n\n\nFigure 5: Clusters of jurisdictions based on the proportions of White and Black death sentences\n\nCluster 0 is purple and represents 352 counties that sentenced people to death at even proportions (50% White and 43% Black). Cluster 1 is blue and represents 175 counties that disproportionally sentence Black people to death (94.1% compared to 5.9%). Cluster 2 is yellow and is the largest representing 408 counties that disproportionally execute White people (97.5% compared to 2.5%). It is interesting that counties who execute Whites more than Blacks represent the largest component of the data, considering that in the earlier analysis we found that White and Black people made up very similar amounts of overall sentencing. To understand why this is occurring, the volume of sentencing was added to the plot as the size of the bubble. Figure 6 indicates that counties that sentence Black people to death disproportionally also have a higher volume of sentencing. Cluster 2 has a lot of counties, but most of them had very few overall sentences. This explains how the total number of Black death sentences can be similar to White death sentences despite fewer sub-jurisdictions.\n\n\nFigure 6: Bubble plot showing death sentences by race proportions and total volume, with clusters highlighting variations in sentencing patterns and case distributions across jurisdictions\n\nBased on the above, there do seem to be racial disparities in the death penalty, even without considering crime data. Even with crime rates, it would be hard to determine if the crime rates were based on arrests that were also racially fueled. However, it is important to note that according to a case study, “Official record studies consistently show that Blacks exhibit higher levels of involvement in criminal offending than Whites do”1. On the other hand, when looking at murder (a leading cause of death penalty sentence), it is reported that White people committed 8,842 murders in 2023 while Black people committed 6,405 murders2.\nLooking at a different dataset and from the opposite perspective, we were able to look at death penalty sentences based on the race of victim in each case. There were a total of 1,149 male victims and 1,107 female victims. Out of the male victims, 862 (75%) were White, 183 (16%) were Black, and 104 (9%) were Latino/a. Out of the female victims, 873 (79%) were White, 175 (16%) were Black, and 59 (5%) were Latino/a. This shows a huge lean towards people receiving the death penalty for killing White individuals.\nSome last key findings are that 98.1% of death penalty sentences were given to men, and that people were more likely to get the death penalty in prior years, as seen in Figure 7.\n\n\nFigure 7: Yearly trend of death penalty cases, showing a peak in the 1990s followed by a steady decline in case frequency over the subsequent decades\n\n\n\n\nThe methodology encompassed a range of approaches, from simple bar chart visualizations to advanced clustering techniques for analyzing sentence similarities. Key findings were derived using unsupervised learning methods, including K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Additionally, geographic maps illustrated the spread of death penalty cases. To enhance analysis, I also employed supervised learning methods such as random forests and decision trees to predict the likelihood of a death penalty verdict based on features like state, race, gender, crime type, and year. Although county-level data was unavailable due to dataset limitations, the models achieved an impressive 98% accuracy, highlighting the predictive power of these features in understanding death penalty outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe death penalty is very controversial and currently a hot political topic in 2024. With a new administration transitioning into office, we can likely expect to see some shift in sentiment at the highest levels. President Donald Trump rushed a significant number of executions in 2020 just before leaving office3. People’s lives are at stake and in the hands of the U.S. government and the politicians that represent our many states and counties. Through the research done for this project, disparities were found regarding how, where, and to whom the death penalty is applied. Only 6% of all counties in the United States that issued a death sentence make up 50% of all death sentences. Further, the counties that issue the largest amount of death sentences tend to disproportionally sentence Black people. Gender, and race of the victim of the crime were also considered and found to play a role in whether the person will receive a death sentence. These differences in sentiment raise a question about the fairness of the death penalty. For example, the fact that two people living next to each other but separated by county lines might receive different sentences. Like most things, especially when they regard politics, the death penalty is much more than it seems. Some people think that the death penalty is serving justice, but others feel that the death penalty goes against the very principle of justice. It is important to not be biased when presenting data about such a sensitive topic, and let the story tell itself, as it does in this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Unknown, A.

    "text": "Webscraping from The Innocence Project\nThis phase involved designing and implementing a Python-based web scraping workflow to extract case details from the Innocence Project website. The following steps outline the process:\n\nTools and Frameworks: The scraping process utilized Selenium, a powerful browser automation tool, to navigate the dynamic content on the website.\nData Collection: Information about exonerees, including their name, state, charge, conviction, sentence, and additional case details, was systematically extracted. Two specific datasets were targeted:\n\nA comprehensive table listing all exonerees.\nA focused table detailing exonerees who faced death penalty convictions.\n\nXPath Selectors: Pre-defined XPath selectors were used to locate and extract specific elements from the webpage. This ensured accurate and efficient data extraction.\nAutomation: The script was designed to loop through a list of case pages, automatically processing each one and saving the extracted data into structured CSV files.\nOutput: The data was stored in two separate CSV files for ease of analysis:\n\nOne containing all exonerees.\nOne specifically focused on exonerees who were sentenced to death.\n\n\nThis approach streamlined the data collection process and ensured the accuracy and completeness of the datasets.\n\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import

Subsequent nodes examine features like murder, state_New York, and number_of_white_victims, reflecting their influence on classification. The tree structure reveals patterns in the data, such as certain states and victim demographics being associated with specific outcomes. The Gini score in the decision tree represents the level of impurity or mixedness at each node. A Gini score of 0 means the node is perfectly pure, meaning all samples belong to one class (e.g., all are “Death Penalty” cases or all are “No Death Penalty” cases). A higher Gini score (closer to 0.5) indicates more mixed samples at that node. As the tree splits based on features, the Gini score decreases, which means the nodes become purer, helping the model make more accurate classifications."
