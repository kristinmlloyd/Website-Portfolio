    "text": "2.1 Historical Context\nSudan faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis as civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) enters its third year. Since April 2023, approximately 150,000 people have died and 14 million been displaced. Three million refugees have fled to neighboring countries, while 30 million need humanitarian assistance. The UN warns Sudan faces the “world’s largest hunger crisis.”\nThe conflict stems from a power struggle between SAF leader Burhan and RSF commander Hemedti after they jointly overthrew dictator Bashir in 2019. Foreign involvement has complicated peace efforts. Recently, SAF has gained territory around Khartoum, while RSF continues committing atrocities in Darfur, raising concerns of renewed genocide (Foreign Relations 2024)."

Incidents surge, peaking in 2024 with the SAF counteroffensive and high-profile events like the assassination of the Darfur governor.\n2025: Incident numbers drop significantly following the SAF’s recapture of Khartoum areas, suggesting a potential shift in conflict intensity or a redistribution of control.\n\nThese patterns indicate that spikes in violence are closely tied to leadership changes, territorial contests, and transitions in power, reinforcing the need for real-time monitoring during political turning points."

The high proportion of fatalities relative to injuries also suggests that many attacks are deliberately lethal.

This likely reflects reduced humanitarian presence rather than improved security conditions, as many organizations withdrew from high-risk areas.\n\nThis pattern reveals a complex relationship between political developments and humanitarian security in Mali, where periods of apparent improvement may actually signal reduced operational capacity rather than enhanced security conditions."

This reflects their greater exposure on the ground, often serving in front-line or field-based roles where risks are highest.\nWhile international staff are affected, their casualty numbers remain comparatively low—likely due to stricter security protocols, evacuation mechanisms, and lower operational presence in high-risk zones."

This was particularly helpful when organizing country-specific narratives and understanding overlapping crises.\nLeveraged the LLM to brainstorm and debug advanced interactive visualizations, especially those involving animation, filtering, and custom styling. While the model provided guidance, I actively engaged in the coding process and deepened my understanding of the tools and techniques involved.\n\nOverall, the LLM served as a learning companion, offering support without replacing the analytical or creative thinking that went into the work."

This decline likely reflects reduced humanitarian presence rather than genuine security improvements, as it coincides with increased intercommunal violence and restricted access.\n\nThis pattern illustrates how formal political agreements in South Sudan have often failed to translate into improved security for humanitarian operations, with peaks in incidents paradoxically occurring during supposed “peace” periods, while recent declines may mask deteriorating conditions and shrinking humanitarian space."

    "text": "3.2 Key Findings\n\n3.2.1 Staff Nationality and Casualty Patterns\nThere is a consistent disparity in security incidents affecting national versus international staff:\n\nNational staff account for a significant amount of all casualities (killed, wounded, and kidnapped)\n\nThis pattern represents both an operational challenge and an ethical concern for humanitarian organizations attempting to manage risk equitably.\n\n\n\n\n    Humanitarian Security Incidents by Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Attack Methods, Contexts, and Locations\nAttack methods, contexts, and locations vary significantly across these eight conflict zones, reflecting differences in conflict dynamics, armed actor capabilities, and tactical objectives:\n\n\n\n\n    Top Three Attack Methods, Contexts & Locations by Country\n\n\n    0–49\n    50–99\n    100–149\n    150+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanitarian security threats vary widely, with common attack methods including kidnappings, ambushes, shootings, and exposure to crossfire. These threats often occur during travel or in insecure compounds, highlighting the need for context-specific strategies. Ambushes require secure movement planning, crossfire zones need early warning systems and shelter, and areas prone to kidnappings or compound attacks demand staff training and physical site protection. Road travel remains especially risky, emphasizing the importance of route assessments and convoy protocols to safeguard aid workers.\n\n\n3.2.3 Political Transitions Create Vulnerability Windows\nSecurity incidents consistently spike during political turmoil. Contributing factors identified in our analysis include:\n\nPeace agreements\nCoups and regime changes\nTerritorial control shifts\n\n\n\n\n  Select a country below to learn more about the conflict it has faced.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syria\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Occupied Palestinian Territories\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Afghanistan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Somalia\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      South Sudan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Sudan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      DR Congo\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Mali\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Missing Context, Hidden Risks\nMissing data remains a major challenge. In several countries, over one-third of incidents lack key contextual information—limiting our ability to fully understand patterns of violence and potentially underrepresenting specific threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to uneven documentation quality, we prioritized variables with higher data completeness—namely location, means of attack, and attack context—as the main points of analysis, reflecting a reporting emphasis on “what” happened rather than “who” was responsible."

Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the country descended into civil war, eventually leading to Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, a US-led coalition overthrew the Taliban regime, establishing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The subsequent two decades saw ongoing insurgency, with the Taliban gradually regaining control of territory despite the presence of international forces (Foreign Relations 2024). Key developments included:\n\n2001-2014: NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission\n2014-2021: NATO Resolute Support Mission focused on training Afghan forces\n2020: US-Taliban peace agreement signed in Doha, Qatar\nAugust 2021: Taliban takeover following US and NATO withdrawal"

    "text": "2.1 Historical Context\nThe conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo represents one of Africa’s most complex and enduring crises. Rooted in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the violence has evolved through two major regional wars—the First Congo War (1996-1997) and the Second Congo War (1998-2003)—which collectively resulted in millions of deaths. Despite formal peace agreements, eastern DRC has remained unstable, with over 120 different armed groups competing for territory, resources, and influence in the mineral-rich regions of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces (Foreign Relations 2024)."

This represented the culmination of escalating violence that began with M23’s resurgence in 2022 and their steady territorial gains throughout 2023. The situation had already deteriorated significantly following DRC’s contested December 2023 elections, which sparked nationwide unrest.

Bodily assault represents the third most common tactic. The high prevalence of kidnappings aligns with documented tactics by armed groups in eastern DRC, particularly by militia groups seeking ransom or using abductions to intimidate local populations and establish territorial control."

The high number of ambushes aligns with the geographical characteristics of the conflict zone, where dense forests and limited road infrastructure create ideal conditions for surprise attacks by M23 rebels and other armed groups. The substantial number of unknown contexts points to the challenges in documenting incidents in remote areas with limited monitoring presence."

This pattern aligns with reports from UN agencies documenting extensive use of kidnapping by the various groups. The disproportionate impact on nationals versus internationals highlights how Congolese civilians bear the overwhelming burden of the conflict. source"
