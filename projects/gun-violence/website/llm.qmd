Throughout the development of this firearm mortality analysis project, we utilized large language models as a supplementary tool. This brief log documents how LLMs were incorporated while maintaining the educational value and originality of the work.

### How LLMs Were Used

- **Code assistance**: Helped troubleshoot errors and suggest syntax improvements for statistical analyses
- **Visualization enhancements**: Provided ideas for clearer data visualizations
- **Interpretation suggestions**: Offered alternative ways to interpret statistical findings
- **Document organization**: Assisted with structuring the Quarto documents

### Learning Process

While LLMs provided technical assistance, they functionally served as an interactive reference rather than replacing the learning process. Throughout this project:

- We developed a deeper understanding of regression techniques and their applications
- We made all key analytical decisions and interpretations based on my understanding of the data
- We critically evaluated LLM suggestions rather than implementing them without consideration
- The conceptualization of the project and research questions remained entirely our own

### Added Value Without Replacing Creativity

The use of LLMs enhanced the project's execution without diminishing its educational or creative aspects.
