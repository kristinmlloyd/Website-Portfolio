### ðŸ”¹ Core Pages

- [**Executive Summary**](index.qmd)  
  Overview of the project examining firearm mortality across U.S. states, key research questions about socioeconomic and policy predictors, data sources, and why a multidimensional approach to understanding gun violence prevention matters.

- [**Exploratory Data Analysis**](eda.qmd)  
  Detailed examination of patterns in state-level firearm mortality data.

- [**Logistic Regression**](logistic_regression.qmd)  
  Comparison of three different logistic regression models (Standard, Lasso/L1, and Ridge/L2) to predict whether states have above-median firearm mortality rates, evaluation of model performance metrics, and analysis of which policy domains most strongly predict mortality outcomes.

- [**Linear Regression**](linear_regression.qmd)  
Comparison of three regression approaches (Principal Component Regression, Backward Stepwise Regression, and Hierarchical Regression) to quantify relationships between socioeconomic factors, gun policies, and firearm mortality rates, with cross-validation to assess generalizability. 

- [**LLM Log**](llm.qmd)  
Documentation of how large language models were used throughout the project to assist with analysis planning, code development, interpretation of statistical results
